## üèπ Game Overview

Archess is played on a standard 8x8 chessboard with all traditional chess pieces, plus the addition of **Archer** pieces that replace specific pawns and introduce ranged combat mechanics.

### Key Features

- **Human vs Human** gameplay
- **Human vs Computer (Random CPU)** mode
- **Touch-friendly** interface for mobile devices
- **Visual move highlighting** with color-coded attack ranges
- **Move history tracking**
- **Check/Checkmate detection**
- **Responsive design** that works on all screen sizes

## üèπ The Archer Piece

### Starting Position
- **White Archers**: Replace pawns on B2 and G2
- **Black Archers**: Replace pawns on B7 and G7

### Movement Rules
Archers can move **one space in any direction** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), but **only to empty squares**. They cannot capture pieces by moving into them.

### Attack Rules
Archers perform **ranged attacks** on enemy pieces that are **1 or 2 cells away directly in front** of them:

- **Valid Targets**: Pawns, Bishops, Kings, Knights, and other Archers
- **Attack Range**: 1 or 2 cells directly forward (vertical only)
- **No Movement**: The Archer stays in its original position after attacking
- **Visual Indicator**: Ranged attack targets are highlighted in red

### Special Rule: Knight Paralysis üéØ
When an Archer attacks a Knight, a coin is flipped automatically:
- **Heads**: The Knight becomes paralyzed and cannot move for the rest of the game
- **Tails**: The Knight takes no damage and can still move normally

Paralyzed Knights appear grayed out and cannot be selected or moved.

### Defense
Archers can be captured by any piece, including other Archers, following standard chess capture rules.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Select a Piece**: Click or tap on one of your pieces to select it
2. **View Possible Moves**: 
   - Green highlights show normal moves
   - Red highlights show ranged attack targets
3. **Make Your Move**: Click or tap on a highlighted square to move or attack
4. **Turn-Based Play**: Players alternate turns (White goes first)

## üß† Human vs Computer Mode

Archess now supports a Human vs Computer mode, where the black pieces are controlled by a CPU player using a greedy random strategy:

- **Random Mode Logic:**
  - If any black piece can attack a white piece, the CPU randomly selects one of these attacking moves and performs it.
  - If no attacks are possible, the CPU randomly selects one of its pieces and makes a random valid move **that gets closer to a white piece** (prefers moves that reduce the distance to the nearest white piece).
  - The CPU always avoids moves that would put its own king in check.
  - All special rules (archer attacks, knight paralysis, etc.) are respected by the CPU.

This mode can be selected from the dropdown menu at the top of the game screen. The CPU will automatically make its move after the human (white) player's turn.

## üéØ Strategy Tips

- **Archer Positioning**: Place Archers where they can control key forward squares
- **Knight Protection**: Be cautious when attacking Knights - the coin flip adds uncertainty
- **Ranged Pressure**: Use Archers to apply pressure without exposing them to immediate capture
- **King Safety**: Remember that Archers can attack Kings from a distance
