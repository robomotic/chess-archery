- **Multiple AI Opponents**: Random, Greedy, and strategic Minimax AI
- **Enhanced Move History** with detailed piece notation
- **Touch-friendly** interface for mobile devices
- **Visual move highlighting** with color-coded attack ranges

## üèπ The Archer Piece

### Starting Position
- **White Archers**: Replace pawns on B2 and G2
- **Black Archers**: Replace pawns on B7 and G7

### Movement Rules
Archers can move **one space in any direction** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), but **only to empty squares**. They cannot capture pieces by moving into them.

### Attack Rules
Archers perform **ranged attacks** on enemy pieces that are **1 or 2 cells away directly in front** of them:

- **Valid Targets**: Pawns, Bishops, Kings, Knights, and other Archers
- **Attack Range**: 1 or 2 cells directly forward (vertical only)
- **No Movement**: The Archer stays in its original position after attacking
- **Visual Indicator**: Ranged attack targets are highlighted in red

### Special Rule: Knight Paralysis üéØ
When an Archer attacks a Knight, a coin is flipped automatically:
- **Heads**: The Knight becomes paralyzed and cannot move for the rest of the game
- **Tails**: The Knight takes no damage and can still move normally

Paralyzed Knights appear grayed out and cannot be selected or moved.

### Defense
Archers can be captured by any piece, including other Archers, following standard chess capture rules.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Select a Piece**: Click or tap on one of your pieces to select it
2. **View Possible Moves**: 
   - Green highlights show normal moves
   - Red highlights show ranged attack targets
3. **Make Your Move**: Click or tap on a highlighted square to move or attack
4. **Turn-Based Play**: Players alternate turns (White goes first)
5. **Game Modes**: Select from Human vs Human or three AI difficulty levels
6. **Move History**: Review detailed notation of all moves including piece types and special actions

## üß† AI Opponents

Archess features multiple AI difficulty levels, each with unique strategies:

### **Random AI** üé≤
- **Strategy**: Opportunistic with random movement
- **Behavior**: 
  - Prioritizes attacks when available
  - Makes random moves that approach opponent pieces
  - Avoids moves that put its own king in check
- **Difficulty**: Beginner-friendly

### **Greedy AI** üéØ  
- **Strategy**: Material-focused tactical play
- **Behavior**:
  - Always captures the highest-value piece available
  - Uses standard chess piece values (Queen=9, Rook=5, etc.)
  - Falls back to positional play when no captures exist
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate challenge

### **Minimax AI** üß†
- **Strategy**: Advanced strategic planning with lookahead
- **Behavior**:
  - Thinks 2-4 moves ahead using minimax algorithm
  - Evaluates positions based on material, position, king safety, and mobility
  - Uses alpha-beta pruning for optimal performance
  - Time-controlled computation (under 150ms per move)
- **Difficulty**: Advanced strategic opponent

All AI modes respect Archess special rules including archer ranged attacks and knight paralysis mechanics.

## üéØ Strategy Tips

- **Archer Positioning**: Place Archers where they can control key forward squares
- **Knight Protection**: Be cautious when attacking Knights - the coin flip adds uncertainty
- **Ranged Pressure**: Use Archers to apply pressure without exposing them to immediate capture
- **King Safety**: Remember that Archers can attack Kings from a distance
