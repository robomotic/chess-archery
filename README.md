## üèπ The Archer Piece

### Starting Position
- **White Archers**: Replace pawns on B2 and G2
- **Black Archers**: Replace pawns on B7 and G7

### Movement Rules
Archers can move **one space in any direction** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), but **only to empty squares**. They cannot capture pieces by moving into them.

### Attack Rules
Archers perform **ranged attacks** on enemy pieces within their extended range:

- **Valid Targets**: Pawns, Bishops, Kings, Knights, and other Archers
- **Attack Range**: 
  - **Forward**: 1 or 2 cells directly ahead (vertical)
  - **Backward**: 1 or 2 cells directly behind (vertical)
  - **Diagonal**: 1 cell in any diagonal direction
- **No Movement**: The Archer stays in its original position after attacking
- **Visual Indicator**: Ranged attack targets are highlighted in red

### Special Rule: Knight Paralysis üéØ
When an Archer attacks a Knight, a coin is flipped automatically:
- **Heads**: The Knight becomes paralyzed and cannot move for the rest of the game
- **Tails**: The Knight takes no damage and can still move normally

Paralyzed Knights appear grayed out and cannot be selected or moved.

### Defense
Archers can be captured by any piece, including other Archers, following standard chess capture rules.

## üß† AI Opponents

Archess features multiple AI difficulty levels, each with unique strategies:

### **Random AI** üé≤
- **Strategy**: Opportunistic with random movement
- **Behavior**: 
  - Prioritizes attacks when available
  - Makes random moves that approach opponent pieces
  - Avoids moves that put its own king in check
- **Difficulty**: Beginner-friendly

### **Greedy AI** üéØ  
- **Strategy**: Material-focused tactical play
- **Behavior**:
  - Always captures the highest-value piece available
  - Uses standard chess piece values (Queen=9, Rook=5, etc.)
  - Falls back to positional play when no captures exist
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate challenge

### **Minimax AI** üß†
- **Strategy**: Advanced strategic planning with lookahead
- **Behavior**:
  - User-configurable search depth (1-6 levels, default: 3)
  - User-configurable thinking time (1-30 seconds, default: 5)
  - Evaluates positions based on material, position, king safety, and mobility
  - Enhanced evaluation that penalizes check situations (-50 points)
  - Uses alpha-beta pruning for optimal performance
  - Adaptive time management based on user preferences
- **Difficulty**: Advanced strategic opponent with customizable challenge level

All AI modes respect Archess special rules including archer ranged attacks and knight paralysis mechanics.

## üéØ Strategy Tips

- **Archer Positioning**: Place Archers where they can control key squares in multiple directions
- **Enhanced Archer Tactics**: Utilize the new diagonal and backward attack capabilities for defensive positioning

- **Board Editor**: Experiment with custom starting positions to explore new strategic patterns
- **AI Tuning**: Adjust Minimax difficulty by changing search depth and thinking time for optimal challenge
